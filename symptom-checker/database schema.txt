Database name: doctor_data
Table name: doctor_data

Columns: id(number), name(string/varchar), email(string), special(string), cond(string)

example:1, Rhea, rhea@doctor.com, general physician, cold
	2, Rhea, rhea@doctor.com, general physician, fever
	3, Rhea, rhea@doctor.com, general physician, diarrhea
	4, Rhea, rhea@doctor.com, general physician, headache
	5, Anoushka, anoushka@doctor.com, cardiologist, heartburn
etc.

Note: Each doctor needs to have multiple rows associated with all the conditions ('cond' column) they take care of; even if information in all the other columns is the same.
That's the reason doctor Rhea has multiple rows with the same entry for every column except 'cond'.

To incorporate this, a separate column say 'main_doctor_id' can be created in this table doctor_data that serves as a link between this database and the main database.

So, now the data might look something like this -

id(PK), main_doctor_id(This one links to the main database), name   , email, special, cond
1     , 001                                                , Rhea   , ...  , ...    , cold

4     , 001                                                , Rhea   , ...  , ...    , diarrhea
